FIRST retrieve specific information from the chapters (names, numbers, cities, animal types)\r\n2. THEN use the provided tools to calculate or look up additional information\r\n\r\nThe chapters contain all the information you need to query the tools correctly. For example:\r\n- To find an animal\u0027s lifespan, first identify the animal TYPE from the chapter (e.g., \u0022Maple the Hippo\u0022 means Maple is a Hippo), then use get_animal_lifespan with \u0022hippo\u0022\r\n- To find weather, first identify which CITY the character traveled to, then use get_weather with that city name\r\n- To use the magic calculator, first find the QUANTITY mentioned in the chapter, then perform the requested operation\r\n\r\nAnswer each question by using the tools with the correct information from the chapters.",
